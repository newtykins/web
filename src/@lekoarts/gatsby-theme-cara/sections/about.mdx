<h1><Twemoji>About ðŸ¤”</Twemoji></h1>

I am Newt, a 13 year old high-school student from the UK. I am an INFJ-T and I love anime, guitar, photography, and cinema.
I mostly program in JavaScript, but I enjoy branching out to other languages sometimes.
I spend quite a lot of my time on Discord, moderating a couple communities. Feel free to add me.
