## About

I am Newt, a 13 year old high school student from the UK. I am an INFJ-T and I love anime, guitar, and cinema.
I am fluent in JavaScript (and TypeScript), and I am familiar with many JavaScript libraries including React.js and Discord.js. I am slowly learning Java, and I want to learn Japanese.
